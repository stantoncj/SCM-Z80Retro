Worklog for modifying SCM for Z80CPU Rev 2.2 By P.Wilson

Strategy:

- On startup, we need to set the FLASH/ROM banks correctly so that RAM is exposed
- Need to setup the SIO with the non-standard layout of the selects
- Need to calculate the baud correctly to be able to communicate

> Should boot into SCM at this point

- Copy SCM to RAM and switch off flash
- Boot Basic

- Other modules:
- Initialize and recognize CTC
- Test CTC w/SIO?  Does SCM have this pre-built?
- RTC set/read?
- I2C
- SPI
- SD Cards
- Boot CPM from SD card

Step 1: Modify main for new config file, add new config

Created config/config_10_Z80Retro.asm
Included in !Main.asm, commented out config_f1_SC516_118.asm

Make is good!

Step 2: Create a new module

Created Z80Retro.asm Module
