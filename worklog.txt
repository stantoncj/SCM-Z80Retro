Port of the excellent SCMonitor from Steve Cousins https://smallcomputercentral.com/

Goals: 
    1. Rework source to be compiled under sjasmplus https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus (Documentation here: http://z00m128.github.io/sjasmplus/documentation.html)
        This was originally compiled under Steve's custom development environment Small Computer Workshop: https://smallcomputercentral.com/small-computer-workshop/
        Why? I like a challenge. I'm using a Mac. The code is modular and well layed out.
        The main issue is that Steve is using his own standard for compiler directives that need to be translated to more universal ones
        Ideally this should just be a series of translations that can be applied to a new release of SCMonitor
        Should yield binary equivalent output files

    2. Add hardware support for the Z80 Retro board by Peter Wilson: https://github.com/peterw8102/Z80-Retro
        Why? This board has a wide variety of hardware support (banked ROM/RAM, SIO, CTC, RTC, SPI, i2c) although it isn't as developed as the RC2014 or MGH z80 projects
        Known Challenge is that this has a funky io map for the SIO that doesn't match a known config

Worklog:

Create working fork:
- Downloaded source from https://smallcomputercentral.com/small-computer-monitor-v1-3/
- Created an SCM Github Repository
- Unzip and move the code from SCMonitor directory to SCM
- Check in code

Scope problem:
- Determine all directives used in code
- Wrote awk script to extract all directives in *.asm (see scw2sjasm.sh)
#DEFINE
#ELSE
#ENDIF
#ENDIF
#IF
#IFDEF
#IFNDEF
#INCLUDE
#INSERTHEX
#TARGET
#UNDEFINE

- ToDo: map these directives to sjasmplus equivalents
- Luckly comments (;) are similarly treated 
- OBS! directives are # in column 0 whereas sjasplus expects pseudo operators (start of line whitespace required) and only labels can be in column 0
- Defined awk for all statements that apply and tested
- missing #INSERTHEX (if using ROM BASIC or CPM)
- missing #TARGET (not needed only for SCW)
- check back in

- move to awk file to debug multiline awk
- runs without quotes but only runs first command #DEFINE and doubles up line?  Check what the !\^ statement is?
- corrected awk file to match and alter only lines matched i.e. {print; next;} and default to {print} for all other lines
- tests correctly against !Main.asm (#DEFINE and #INCLUDE)
- cannot get -v debug=Y to work, brute forcing as a comment
- seperated out scw2sjasm.sh to run the recursive awk command
- chmod 755 scw2sjasm.sh 
- shell script runs correctly for debug
- check in code

- pre-reqs: (on OSX 10.15.7 Catalina):
- the default OSX distribution of awk lacks -i INPLACE support (WTF Apple?)
- install brew:
- brew install gawk
- did a brew update (3 hours), why do I do this to myself?  Note to self to remove some old experiments: awscli, mongodb, kubernetes-cli, openjdk, mysql-client, helm, node, kubernetes-cli, etc. audit this!
- got -i infile to work correctly, modified all files in tree

- ran ./scw2sjasm.sh to modify directives in all files
- ran sjasmplus '!Main.asm' to compile, next issue:

API.asm(21): error: Unrecognized instruction: .CODE
FDOS.asm(7): error: Unrecognized instruction: .CODE

- commented this out as there is no equivalent in sjasmplus
